# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Product Management website that allows users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products. The system will be built using PHP and MySQL with Bootstrap for styling, providing a clean and user-friendly interface for managing product inventory.

### Requirement 5

5. WHEN handling file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes for security

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear setup instructions, so that I can easily deploy and configure the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria
